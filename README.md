# Migale: A lightweight .NET spider with fast kickstarting

Migale was born out of a need to extract quickly and with a very low development cost. This package is not intended to replace complete and structured libraries like [DotnetSpider](https://github.com/dotnetcore/DotnetSpider). 


| Package | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Migale.Core](https://github.com/Velka-DEV/Migale/tree/main/src/Migale.Core) | The core of the project |
| [Migale.Crawlers.HttpClient](https://github.com/Velka-DEV/Migale/tree/main/src/Migale.Crawlers.HttpClient) | The HttpClient crawler implementation with RequestMessages |
| [Migale.Crawlers.Playwright](https://github.com/Velka-DEV/Migale/tree/main/src/Migale.Crawlers.Playwright) | The Playwright crawler implementation with browser automation |
